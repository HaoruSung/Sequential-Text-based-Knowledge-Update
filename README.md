# Sequential Text-based Knowledge Update with Self-Supervised Learning for Generative Language Models
- This work proposes a new natural language processing (NLP) task to tackle the issue of multi-round, sequential text-based knowledge update.
- A dataset was also created for evaluation and results showed the effectiveness of our methodology. 

## Setup

Clone the repo

```bash
git clone https://github.com/HaoruSung/Sequential-Text-based-Knowledge-Update.git
cd Sequential-Text-based-Knowledge-Update
```

install dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

You are all set! ðŸŽ‰

## Finetune the model

```bash
python Finetune/fine_tuning_t5_model.py
```
