# Sequential Text-based Knowledge Update with Self-Supervised Learning for Generative Language Models
- This work proposes a new natural language processing (NLP) task to tackle the issue of multi-round, sequential text-based knowledge update.
- A dataset was also created for evaluation and results showed the effectiveness of our methodology. 


This is the code for the ACM CIKM 2023 paper :
